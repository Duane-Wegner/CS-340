# **Reflection**

### **How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

I focused on using clear variable names, breaking the code into smaller, modular functions, and adding comments to explain the logic. This ensures the code is easy to read, maintain, and update. For example, in Project One, I designed each CRUD method to handle specific database tasks, making it easy to modify or expand later. This modular design allows for future updates, such as adding new database operations or connecting with other systems. In the future, this module could be reused in other MongoDB-based projects, saving time.

### **How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

For the Grazioso Salvare project, I started by analyzing the data structure and identifying the required operations. Then, I designed the database schema and wrote the Python code to interact with it. I broke the problem into smaller tasks: building the CRUD module, developing the dashboard UI, and ensuring smooth database integration. Unlike past assignments, this project required integrating both the backend database and the front-end interface. Moving forward, I would continue using modular development and focus on writing reusable code to meet future client needs.

### **What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?**

Computer scientists use algorithms and software development skills to solve real-world problems, like managing and analyzing data. In this project, I helped Grazioso Salvare by building a dashboard that interacts with a database, improving their data management and decision-making. This type of work helps companies streamline operations, make better data-driven decisions, and keep records accurate and up-to-date. By creating a scalable and user-friendly solution, I helped the company achieve its goals more efficiently.
